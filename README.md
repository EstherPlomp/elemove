## About this project and data

This dataset tracks 14 adult female elephants over some 2 years in Kruger National Park, South Africa, and has been used for a number of projects, including seasonal movements, movement in response to fire, and in response to the thermal landscape.

These projects were led by [Rob Slotow*](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/people/professor-rob-slotow), [Maria Thaker](https://mariathaker.weebly.com/), and [Abi Vanak](https://www.atree.org/users/dr-abi-tamim-vanak). See the data access section for citation details.

I worked on this data in 2017 -- 2018 while a research assistant with Maria Thaker and Abi Vanak at CES, IISc, and ATREE, in Bangalore, India.
I also uploaded the data to Movebank in 2018, and together with Candace Vinciguerra from _Movebank_, published the dataset under the project leaders' names in the data repository. The data now forms part of the _Movebank_ homepage animation, which is very cool to see.
